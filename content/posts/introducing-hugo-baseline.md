Hugo Baseline is a simple, clean, production-grade theme that gives you exactly what you need to build a professional website—without the bloat or complexity of feature-heavy themes.

## What Is Hugo Baseline?

Hugo Baseline is an intentionally minimal theme that's comprehensive in functionality. It includes everything you need for a production website: built-in search index generation, complete SEO setup with OpenGraph and Twitter Cards, JSON-LD structured data, optional dark mode, related posts, table of contents, analytics integration, and more.

The theme handles all the foundational features that should "just work"—proper RSS feeds with discoverability tags, automatic social media image fallbacks, UTM tracking for external links, click-to-copy code blocks, pagination, custom 404 pages, print styles, and Microformats support.

## Why Hugo Baseline Exists

Hugo needed a simple yet production-grade theme that developers could confidently build upon. Most themes are either too bare-bones for real-world use or too opinionated with features you don't need. Basic functionality like SEO metadata, RSS integration, and structured data often require manual work or are improperly configured in common themes.

The goal was to create one solid theme for building multiple sites—stop reinventing the wheel for every new Hugo project. Whether you're building a blog, documentation site, or company website, Baseline provides the same reliable foundation with everything configured correctly from day one.

## Who Should Use It

Baseline is perfect for developers who want a solid foundation without unnecessary complexity, content creators who need a reliable SEO-friendly theme, teams building multiple Hugo sites that need consistency, and anyone who values production-grade quality in a simple package.
